				<h2>Data Analytiks, My Data Science Startup</h2>
				<p>I founded Data Analytiks in September 2022 and have been working part-time at this company since
					then. My expertise extends beyond just technical skills in Python and machine learning; it
					encompasses strategic consulting for both emerging and current data science projects, ensuring that
					my
					approaches are not only innovative but also closely aligned with market trends and demands.

					Mainly working in Python, I have applied machine learning techniques on call-center data to
					predict call outcomes, resulting in a 20% improvement in caller sales. Additionally, I have
					implemented Natural
					Language Processing techniques to automate and correct caller data filling processes,
					significantly enhancing the
					quality of data provided to callers and cients. Conducting Sentiment Analysis using LLMs, I have
					also
					worked on enhancing sales speech strategies which provided deep insights into the behaviors that
					callers should adopt
					with respect to prospects. Currently, I am also leading a project in collaboration with an
					investment
					group, utilizing NLP and cloud computing to analyze LinkedIn data for client targeting, aiming to
					predict
					client behaviors and enable proactive business strategies.
					I have successfully collaborated with various companies across three different
					countries: Spain, France, and the UK. Data Analytiks has made a promising start, and I will continue
					to actively contribute to the
					development of Data Analytiks until the beginning of my internship.

				<h2>Analysis of non-linear air pollution in Python and R</h2>
				<p>Conducted an impactful analysis of non-linear air pollution as part of a project for the
					<a href="https://datascience.ch/">Swiss Data Science Center (SDSC)</a>.
					Utilized Python and R to perform a comprehensive spatio-temporal analysis of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)
					and fine particulate matter (PM2.5)
					across Europe. Uncovered key patterns and structures, identified spatial and temporal correlations,
					and provided insights into pollutant
					distribution and atmospheric lifetimes. Findings can contribute to the development of prediction
					models, environmental policy planning,
					and public health strategies, with potential to improve air quality management across Europe and
					beyond. Outstanding results, graded 5.50/6, are being considered for a scientific publication.

				<h2>Science vs Art: Defying the Brain's Divisions in Python</h2>
				<p>This project aims to challenge the stereotype that artistic and scientific people are inherently
					different and not interested in each other's subjects. We analyzed the YouNiverse
					dataset (huge Youtube dataset), which includes 8.6 billion comments and 72 million video metadata
					files, to determine if users who engage with artistic
					videos also engage with scientific videos, and vice versa. We also intend to divide artistic and
					scientific
					videos into smaller domains to examine whether this pattern is influenced by the specific domain of
					art or
					science that the user is interested in. By studying user profiles and our watching/commenting
					behaviors on videos
					that do not typically align with our profiles, we seek to draw conclusions about people's interests.

				<h2>Machine Learning and Deep Learning Time Serie Forecasting in Python and Matlab</h2>
				<p>In this project hosted by the <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/desl-pwrs/">Distributed Electrical
						Systems Laboratory (DESL)</a>, two forecasting models with
					different time windows were developed. They predict
					the electricity consumption of an EPFL building (CM)
					with photovoltaic panels given previous data on the building’s
					electrical consumption and meteorological data (irradiance
					and temperature). The pre-processing steps taken with
					the data, including handling of missing data, the feature
					engineering process used to generate additional relevant
					features, the various models designed using different ML
					approaches and their results are all detailed in the report. The final
					models chosen, artificial neural networks with hypertuned
					parameters, achieve 62.09% accuracy for next-day forecasting
					and 62.96% accuracy for intra-day forecasting. These results had
					been judged excellent by the DESL of EPFL.

					effects of different parameters such as number of epochs and learning rates, as well
					as seeing how data augmentation and freezing some layers affects our results. We
					discovered that with transfer learning, it was possible to classify the image as a cat

					an accuracy of more than 95% when trying to classify the breed of cats and dogs.</p>

				<h2>Development of Laser Scanner Module for SileX System in Fusion 360 and Matlab

				<p>I actively participated in a microengineering project where I played a crucial role in developing a

					the production of large-scale opto-mechanical microsystems in glass. The goal of the project was to
					implement
					flexible guidings to minimize energy losses caused by system friction. I utilized Matlab for
					calculations and
					optimizations, as well as Fusion CAD software for 3D printing and generating the mechanism's
					designs.
					The primary objective was to develop a dynamically balanced two-degree-of-freedom (roll and pitch)

				<h2>MEMS Device for Optical Fiber Control in COMSOL and Klayout</h2>
