				<h2>Data Analytiks, My Data Science Startup</h2>
				<p>I founded Data Analytiks in September 2022 and have been working part-time at this company since
					then. At Data Analytiks, I continuously apply my technical skills in Python, Process Automation
					and Project Management across various innovative projects. Integral to these efforts, I am
					responsible for managing the whole
					data pipeline of projects, from data preprocessing and cleaning to model implementation and
					monitoring. Among my key
					achievements was the development of machine learning models that enhanced call-center efficiency by
					20%. I also
					developed a product using NLP and Large Language Models not only to enhance data insights but also
					to automate the
					process of entering call information into the system, significantly saving caller time and enriching
					the dataset with more
					accurate and comprehensive data. I am currently leading a project in LinkedIn analytics, utilizing
					Large Language Models
					for client behavior prediction and process automation.
					Data Analytiks represents my most ambitious project to date. I have successfully collaborated with
					various
					companies across three different countries: Spain, France, and the UK. Data Analytiks has made a
					promising start and makes me completely financially independent.
					<!-- Mainly working in Python, I have utilized machine learning techniques on call-center data to
					predict call outcomes,
					resulting in a 20% improvement in caller efficiency. Additionally, I have implemented Natural
					Language Processing (NLP) techniques with 90% accuracy to automate and correct caller data filling
					processes. Conducting Sentiment Analysis, I have also worked on enhancing sales speech strategies.
					Currently, I am collaborating with an investment group on the development of additional products.
					Data Analytiks represents my most ambitious project to date. I have successfully collaborated with
					various
					companies across three different countries: Spain, France, and the UK. Data Analytiks has made a
					promising start,
					achieving a margin of approximately 20,000 Swiss Francs within its first year. I will continue to
					actively contribute to
					the development of Data Analytiks until the beginning of my master's thesis, marking the end of this
					interesting experience. -->

					Utilized Python and R to perform a comprehensive spatio-temporal analysis of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)

					across Europe. Uncovered key patterns and structures, identified spatial and temporal correlations,
					and provided insights into pollutant
					distribution and atmospheric lifetimes. Findings can contribute to the development of prediction

				<h2>Applied Data Analysis: Defying the Brain's Divisions in Python</h2>
				<p>This project aims to challenge the stereotype that artistic and scientific people are inherently
					different and not interested in each other's subjects. We analyzed the YouNiverse
					dataset (huge Youtube dataset), which includes 8.6 billion comments and 72 million video metadata
					files, to determine if users who engage with artistic
					videos also engage with scientific videos, and vice versa. We also intend to divide artistic and
					scientific
					videos into smaller domains to examine whether this pattern is influenced by the specific domain of
					art or
					science that the user is interested in. By studying user profiles and our watching/commenting
					behaviors on videos
					that do not typically align with our profiles, we seek to draw conclusions about people's interests.
